This is a simple .NET app which offers a RESTful service and a static HTML page. I'm favoriong simplicity here over good software engineering practices. I repeat: **this is not a good way to develop an API and a web page**. This two-part project is primarly about getting all of the other things around the code to work. I want you to spend as little time actually coding as possible. In fact, **you may use generative AI for as much of the C# and HTML work as you like.** 

To run this code, I recommend using VS Code. Instructions on using VS Code for C# development can be found [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/csharp). Once VS Code is configured, you should be able to run the solution by pressing F5. This will provide feedback in the "Debug Console" and open your browser to https://localhost:7271/swagger/index.html. You should also be able to reach our static HTML (file found at wwwroot/index.html) at https://localhost:7271/index.html.

Swagger should be able to do any other HTTP method you eventually need. However, if you encounter issues, you can always resort to tools like curl or Postman.
